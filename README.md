# Control and Navigation of TurtleBot3 ground robots using MATLAB's ROS and Navigation Toolbox.

This repository contains MATLAB and C++ codes along with Gazebo files needed to simulate the motion of a robot in a environment.

The ground robot used in this project is the [TurtleBot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/). Some of the models of the robot are as shown below:

Using [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) one can simulate a environment as close to the real world as possible. Some of the environment used in this project are as shown below:
