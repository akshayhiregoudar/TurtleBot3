# Control and Navigation of TurtleBot3 ground robots using MATLAB's ROS and Navigation Toolbox.

This repository contains MATLAB and C++ codes along with Gazebo files needed to simulate the motion of a robot in a environment.

## TurtleBot3

The ground robot used in this project is the [TurtleBot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/). Some of the models of the robot are as shown below:

## Gazebo

[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) is a open-source 3D robotics simulator using which one can simulate a environment as close to the real world as possible. Some of the environment used in this project are as shown below:

## ROS Toolbox

* Provides an interface connecting MATLAB and Simulink with ROS and ROS2, thereby enabling us to create a network of ROS nodes.
* Create, send, and receive messages, topics, and network information.
* Create custom ROS messages.

## Navigation Toolbox

* Provides algorithms and analysis tools for designing the motion planning and navigation systems.
* Can be used to calibrate and simulate IMU, GPS, and range sensors.
* To implement SLAM algorithms with lidar scans.
* Used to create occupancy maps of the environment.
